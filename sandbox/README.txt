I often add a /sandbox folder to data exploration projects as a staging area for objects/class
while in the phase of just understanding the api's, etl methods, and analyses required by 
the project. This folder just contains half baked classes and scripts that either
graduate into fully-formed objects, get absorbed elsewhere, or are ultimately discarded.
Also notes about api's and other tidbits.
