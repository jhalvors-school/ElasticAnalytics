For now this repo is mostly sandbox code exploring the use of elk clients
and analyzing the properties of our elastic data. It will become more organized
once those distributions, tools, and methods are understood better.

This project is currently just a pre-alpha for requirements analyses and data exploration,
and will be rolled into a cleaner project-repo once requirements are better known.
